TODO:

I (pravin) changed the order of pricing section's selectors. Check if anything broke.

The hero text should be clamped according to the viewport, such that it appears in the blue-water-part in each device.

The hero image doesn't occupy the complete screen and leaves a black patch towards the end of the screen.

Change the dimensions of the "Safety first approach" so that the resize-animation is better than the current one.

Box-shadow and linear gradient of destination section.

Button hover effects.

Destination section: 
    => Box shadow, linear gradient to the parent container
    => Text appears way too large. Fix using clamp.

The price title looks congested. Improve the surrounding spacing.

In the price section: while flipping the card a black circle shaped structure appears at the bottom left. 

Linear gradient for the testimonials section.

Analyse and configure the margin top for each section

Opening a modal (with the effects similar to Slicicious) on clicking the "Schedule now" nav button.
